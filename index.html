            Gigen, you are a Libra!
            On the full moon of November 3, resolve something that
            has been annoying or worrying you. It may not be important
            in the long run, but it could feel that way now. You have
            more than enough resources and lots of moral support. On
            the thirteenth, Venus conjoins Jupiter in Scorpio. Something
            or someone could touch or steal your heart. Money and material
            possessions are highlighted with the new moon on November 18.
            Pretty things look prettier and more desirable than usual.
            You might be tempted to go on a spending spree. Maybe leave
            your plastic at home and do some serious window-shopping.
